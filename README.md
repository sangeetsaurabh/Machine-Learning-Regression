## Machine Learning: Regression

Regularized linear regression models for prediction and feature selection:

   1. Describe the input and output of a regression model.
   
   2. Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
   
   3. Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
   
   4. Tune parameters with cross validation.
   5. Analyze the performance of the model.
   6. Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
   7. Deploy methods to select between models.
   8. Exploit the model to form predictions. 
   9. Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.
   10. Implement these techniques in Python.
