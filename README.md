## Machine Learning: Regression

Regularized linear regression models for prediction and feature selection:

   -Describe the input and output of a regression model.
   -Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
   -Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
   -Tune parameters with cross validation.
   -Analyze the performance of the model.
   -Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
   -Deploy methods to select between models.
   -Exploit the model to form predictions. 
   -Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.
   -Implement these techniques in Python.
